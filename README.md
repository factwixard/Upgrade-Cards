# Upgrade-Cards
Adds upgrades focused on playing cards that flavors and enhances deckbuilding.

Just something I wanted to make since it seems like not many mods use perma-bonuses and I wanted to play around with those.

## Features:

-1 new consumable type: Upgrades

-17 total Upgrade cards, with 1 being a Spectral card

-8 Booster Packs, all to give you more Upgrades

-1 tag, since I wanted to make one
